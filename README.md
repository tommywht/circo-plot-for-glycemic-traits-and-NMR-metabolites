## Ciro plots for glycemic traits and NMR metabolites

This repo contains R scripts for creating circo plots for results of Mendelian randomisation analysis with glycemic traits as exposure variables and NMR metabolites in UK Biobank as outcome variables. Scripts were modified from the [EpiViz](https://github.com/mattlee821/EpiViz) package.
